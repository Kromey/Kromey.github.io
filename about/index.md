Kromey, or Travis Veazey as he is more commonly known in the "real world", is a programmer, web designer, and systems and network administrator, both by trade and by hobby. His current work involves managing the network and servers of a good-sized school district; his current hobby project is a skill-based Rogue-like game.

Travis is skilled in C/C++, PHP, JavaScript, SQL, HTML/XHTML, and CSS; he is rapidly learning Python and PowerShell to add to his repertoire.
