Got out of surgery a few hours ago. Still feeling the after-effects of the drugs more than anything else. It went well, I'm told.

The strangest part of this whole experience is the lost time - one moment I'm sitting in the chair waiting for the surgeon to come back and tell the anesthetist to start the drugs, and the next moment I'm waking up with an ice pack wrapped around my head and gauze pads stuffed into my mouth. It's not at all like going to sleep - that time's just plain gone! It's really weird - now I know how abductees feel!
