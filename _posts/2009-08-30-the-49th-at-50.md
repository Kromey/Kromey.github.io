Ever been curious about the history of the Union's largest state? A [local radio station](http://www.kiak.com/) has produced a 50-part series of short spots covering the highlights of our 50-year history as a state to celebrate the bicentennial. It's a good listen, and they've made it available as a [podcast](http://www.kiak.com/podcast/49that50.xml).
