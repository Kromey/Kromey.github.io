So, here I am again, with yet another new blog. This time, though, I've finally broken down and installed a ready-made one instead of trying (yet again) to motivate myself to actually develop one from scratch. Which has always been a great learning experience, but they never become feature-complete and always seem to suffer from various this-and-thats that I just don't have the time nor motivation to repair.

So, let's make someone else develop my blogging software for me! Hooray, outsourcing!

This time around, this blog will be an amalgamation of my own random thoughts, myriad little things that happen to me, the occasional techie article, and, of course, my own little brand of opinionated blogging.

Enjoy!
