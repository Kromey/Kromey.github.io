While skimming through Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection Manager v2.2 help file, I came across this in bold red text:



<blockquote>
Note: This feature is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Instead of importing servers, you should create a new .rdg file. The format is fairly easy to decipher and will probably be documented someday.
</blockquote>



Someday... Probably...

Awesome!
