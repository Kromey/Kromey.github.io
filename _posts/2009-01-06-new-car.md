I bought a new car Friday! Yay! It's a "magnetic gray metallic" 2009 Toyota Camry, like this pic:

I'm getting the auto-start installed tomorrow, also going to look into the possibility of some heated seats. Needs Blizzaks, too, see about getting those this week.

Is totally awesome car, though! An upgrade in every measure over my 2006 Toyota Corolla that Nini totaled. Glad she did, though - this car rocks!

**Update:** Oops, pic's gone, maybe I'll get around to getting a new one up some day.
