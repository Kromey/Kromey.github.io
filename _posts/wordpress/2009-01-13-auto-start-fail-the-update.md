Turns out the remote died. I went back to Auto Trim Design yesterday morning and they gave me a new remote. Works great now! Apparently mine was the second dead remote they'd seen in two years dealing with this model.

Whatever the failure rate, I'm happy now! Of course, it's a lot warmer now, but the auto-start is still nice.
