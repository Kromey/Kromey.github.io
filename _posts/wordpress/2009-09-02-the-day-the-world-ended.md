I'm sure you already know Gmail went down today. Well, to be precise, the web interface went down. IMAP, POP3, and the API remained available, however users who hadn't enabled access for the former 2 options (such as myself) found themselves cut off from all access to their Gmail. Many of us rely on Gmail for our work, so it was more than a nuisance for us.




I spent the downtime with half an eye on a live Twitter feed for all things Gmail. Some of what came through was amusing:

> 
> 
</blockquote>




Others predicted the end of the world:





<blockquote>

> 
> [theeKENye](http://twitter.com/theeKENye) so gmail is not working, civilization is crumbling before us!!!!
> 
> 
</blockquote>




Some were ironic (at least, I hope so, as this one came through thousands of tweets into the outage):





<blockquote>

> 
> [sarahk47](http://twitter.com/sarahk47) Hey y'all, is gmail down? No one seems to be tweeting about it.
> 
> 
</blockquote>




Some unapologetically begged:





<blockquote>

> 
> [thecx](http://twitter.com/thecx) RT: [@codigoverde](http://twitter.com/codigoverde): Dear Gmail, I'm sorry about all the times I took you for granted, I love you and cherish you so please, come back. [#](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23gmail)[gmail](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23gmail)
> 
> 
</blockquote>




There were some good ideas, too:





<blockquote>

> 
> [aaronpost](http://twitter.com/aaronpost) College RULE in effect - If Gmail is down for 15minutes or more we all get to go home !!!
> 
> 
</blockquote>




And some bad ones:





<blockquote>

> 
> [MikellKober](http://twitter.com/MikellKober) The super speed at which I heard of Gmail problems will probably lead me to ask Twitter if/when I suspect I have cancer/surprise pregnancy
> 
> 
</blockquote>




And a damn good question posed:





<blockquote>

> 
> [MrsRoadshow](http://twitter.com/MrsRoadshow) What's your in-lieu-of-gmail plan? Alternate provider? Jus be glad for a bit of an email vacation? ESP? Other?
> 
> 
</blockquote>




My back-up? The fetal position. But this is a good back-up, too:





<blockquote>

> 
> [NTChaddius](http://twitter.com/NTChaddius) [@DaniAntol](http://twitter.com/DaniAntol) I'm pretending like it's 1998. Gonna reactive AOL, make a hotmail address, and maybe listen to some Spice Girls [#](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23gmail)[gmail](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23gmail) [#fail](http://twitter.com/search?q=%23fail)
> 
> 
</blockquote>




Not even our friends across the pond were safe:





<blockquote>

> 
> [anoine](http://twitter.com/anoine) j'obéit a gmail je réessaie toute les 30 secondes, çela fait 10minutes...
[I obeyed gmail I tried again every 30 seconds, for the last 10 minutes... _Translation from French by myself._]
> 
> </blockquote>




All-in-all, the Twitter feed kept me amused for a while as I did other things. Of course, as my "top priority" item at the time requires an e-mail before it can proceed (which I still haven't gotten, since the outage prevented the questions I'm awaiting answers for going out until after business hours for my customer), I had to occupy my time with lower-priority things. Still awaiting the official word from Google on what actually happened, but at least service is restored.




Giant paste-bomb of some of my favorite tweets from the outage:
