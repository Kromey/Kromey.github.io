I spent the weekend in a town called Poovar. Well, to be more specific, I spent it at a beach resort in Poovar called [Isola Di Cocco](http://www.isoladicocco.com/). I highly recommend the place - great locale, awesome food, superb service all around, and even outdoor bathrooms in each room! And for you budget travelers - my entire weekend, including meals, cost less than US$65 - I've stayed in much lesser hotels in the US for twice that, food _not_ included!

I also discovered that when I have an alarm set to wake me up, I sleep a lot better. Makes sense - without an alarm, I'm checking the time every time I wake up; with one, I just roll over and fall back asleep. I found Nini's watch (she had forgotten the thing even existed!) in the small duffel bag I used when I went to Isla Di Cocco. I've now got it on my bedside table, with the alarm set to wake me up in the morning. Next time I travel, if I forget to pack a travel clock I'm buying one at the first airport I reach!
