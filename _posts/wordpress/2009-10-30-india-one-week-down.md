1 week down, 2 weeks to go.

The food here is amazing. I really wish we had some Indian cuisine back home - I'm going to miss this stuff! Maybe I'll pick up an Indian cookbook and take to cooking more often.

Most meals seem to be eaten with one's hands. It's kind of weird, having grown up with Mom telling me to always use my fork, and then coming here and half the time not even _having_ a fork! But, I'll tell you one thing -Â you haven't lived until you've eaten curry with your fingers!

They're sending me off to the beach for the weekend. Should be fun. :-)
