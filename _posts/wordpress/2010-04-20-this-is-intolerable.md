I normally won't be getting political on this blog, but I came across [this story](http://www.nclrights.org/site/PageServer?pagename=issue_caseDocket_Greene_v_County_of_Sonoma_et_al) and was absolutely floored. Whether or not you support gay marriage, you have to agree that the blatant disregard for due process, existing legal statuses and rights, and simple human decency is frankly appalling! The actions Sonoma County undertook here have no justification, and the end result was an old man who'd lived an amazing life was forced to spend his final months in forced isolation while all his material possessions - keepsakes collected throughout his life - were stripped away and sold off for mere pittances. Meanwhile his partner was forced into a care facility and held there against his will, denied the right to be there for his loved one's final moments.

What justification could there possibly be for this atrocity??
