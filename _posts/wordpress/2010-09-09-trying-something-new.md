I'm trying out a new service that uses a CDN-like technology to both increase this site's security as well as simultaneously improving page load times. They're still in beta themselves, so the site may behave unpredictably in the meantime; let me know if you encounter any issues and I'll pass them along to their support folks (who have already impressed me by responding within minutes to a bug I reported). As for who they are, they want to keep things quiet until they make a big announcement at a tech conference, so I'll respect their wishes and not name them yet.
