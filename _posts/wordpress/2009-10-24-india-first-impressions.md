Well, I've been in India for 16 hours now (give or take). My first impressions:

It's hot and humid, but there's the occasional whiff of sea air that's awful pleasant. There's also a lot of animal/insect sounds constantly, which was annoying at first but now is kind of a pleasant background.

The driving here is terrifying - seems there's few (if any) rules of the road, and at best just a small handful of guidelines. People seem to just drive whereever/however they want to get where they're going. Also, everyone drives on the right, which I guess I should have expected but didn't.

My internet access is spotty, but I'll try to update every few days or so with what's going on.
