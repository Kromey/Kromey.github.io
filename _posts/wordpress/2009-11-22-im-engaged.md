Woo! Here's how it went down:

So, today was our anniversary - been dating for 3 years! So, we spent last night relaxing in the jacuzzi at a nice hotel room, and this evening we enjoyed a very nice dinner at the [Pump House](http://www.pumphouse.com/).

Afterwards, I asked her if it had been a good anniversary; she said it had. I told her I had one more surprise that would make it even better: I got down on my knee, pulled out the ring, and she said "Yes!" before I even finished asking her to marry me!

I'll post pictures of the ring later.
