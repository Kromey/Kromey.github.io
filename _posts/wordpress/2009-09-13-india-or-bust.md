So, I'm going to India. When? Dunno - 3 or 4 weeks, maybe 5. How long? Dunno - 2 weeks? Maybe as much as 4. Why?

Because the company I work for is expanding into the Indian market. We've got a potential client, but to give them the best we can we're working with an Indian development company to branch and then customize our product for them. It's a great opportunity to expand and grow our product and our company.

I'll be heading over there to train the developers on our code base and our development practices. Should be fun.

I'll be in [Trivandrum](http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS291US303&resnum=0&q=trivandrum&um=1&ie=UTF-8&split=0&gl=us), for those who are curious.
