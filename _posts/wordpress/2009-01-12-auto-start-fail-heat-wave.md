Sad news: My brand new auto-start remote died yesterday. It broke into (very loud) song as we returned from breakfast, and then just shut off. I haven't been able to make it work since, even after trying 3 different batteries, one of which came from a brand new pack I bought at the store yesterday. I'm going to swing by Auto Trim Design to see if they can fix it this morning.

In other news, Fairbanks was hit by a heat wave this morning, with temperatures rising up into the teens - negative teens, that is. After two weeks of -40 and colder, this is a welcome reprieve!
